If you are an educator who is interested in starting a course like this one, you are welcome to contact Prof. Haynes Miller (hrm@math.mit.edu) and Susan Ruff (ruff@math.mit.edu).

The following resources provide further background and context supporting this course.

- On June 21, 2013, Prof. Haynes Miller gave a presentation about *Project Laboratory in Mathematics* at the New Directions for Mathematics Research Experiences for Undergraduates conference. {{% resource_link "4939ffc0-002c-38e3-cf9a-046667203e21" "A project laboratory in mathematics (PDF)" %}} is the slide deck used in his presentation.
- On July 31, 2013, Susan Ruff gave a presentation about supporting teamwork in *Project Laboratory in Mathematics* for Project NExT. {{% resource_link "025c341c-3f6b-dcd9-ab93-e897f034ec6a" "Supporting Teamwork In MIT's *Project Lab In Mathematics* (PDF)" %}} is the slide deck used in her presentation.
- A wealth of resources for teaching mathematical communication is available at [MathDL Mathematical Communication](http://mathcomm.org/courses/math-lab-class/), a website hosted by the MAA and co-edited by Prof. Haynes Miller and Susan Ruff. The site originated in the MIT Department of Mathematics and includes resources about this class as well as a wide range of resources for teaching math students to write and give presentations.
